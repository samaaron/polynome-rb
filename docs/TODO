First phase - frame management

Polynome is in a state where frames can be created and displayed

[*] a surface switching mechanism which works with the frame buffer (see TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW)
[*] Move the FrameBuffer into its own class
[*] Give each monome a Display (which includes a FrameBuffer)
[*] Give each monome multiple surfaces
[*] Allow a monome to create a new surface
[*] Allow a monome to destroy a surface
[*] Create an application model
[*] Give each application an interface
[*] Move the cable orientation checks into model
[*] Teach Quadrants how to return possible quadrants given a cable orientation
[*] Add Projection skeleton
[*] Allow an application to register with a given surface
[*] Allow an app connector to specify its rotation on registration
[*] Only permit valid rotations and sizes given the monome's size
[ ] Add ability for an app to determine whether it's on the current surface
[ ] Allow an app to update the surface
[ ] Allow interface frame updates be sent via the surface to the display
[ ] Create a dummy 64 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Create a dummy 128 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Allow the dummy 128 app to be rotated if the device contains a sufficient number of frames
[ ] Allow the monome to have two surfaces each containing a different app
[ ] Allow switching between surfaces - for each app on the surface, update surface
