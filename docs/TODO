First phase - frame management

Polynome is in a state where frames can be created and displayed

[*] a surface switching mechanism which works with the frame buffer (see TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW)
[*] Move the FrameBuffer into its own class
[*] Give each monome a Display (which includes a FrameBuffer)
[*] Give each monome multiple surfaces
[*] Allow a monome to create a new surface
[*] Allow a monome to destroy a surface
[ ] Create an application model
[ ] Give each application an interface
[ ] Allow an interface to register with a given surface
[ ] Allow an interface to specify its rotation on registration
[ ] Only permit valid rotations and sizes given the monome's size
[ ] Allow interface frame updates be sent via the surface to the display
[ ] Create a dummy 64 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Create a dummy 128 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Allow the dummy 128 app to be rotated if the device contains a sufficient number of frames
[ ] Allow the monome to have two surfaces each containing a different app
[ ] Allow switching between surfaces
