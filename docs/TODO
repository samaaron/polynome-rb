First phase - frame management

Polynome is in a state where frames can be created and displayed

[*] a surface switching mechanism which works with the frame buffer (see TECHNICAL_OVERVIEW)
[*] Move the FrameBuffer into its own class
[*] Give each monome a Display (which includes a FrameBuffer)
[ ] Create a dummy 64 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Create a dummy 128 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Allow the dummy 128 app to be rotated if the device contains a sufficient number of frames
[ ] Allow the monome to have two surfaces each containing a different app
[ ] Allow switching between surfaces
