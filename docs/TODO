First phase - frame management

Polynome is in a state where frames can be created and displayed

[ ] Implement Monome#update_frame_buffer such that the frame(s) in the current buffer(s) are made visible on the device
[ ] Build locks around the frame buffer such that only one process can access it at a time
[ ] Create a worker thread that checks the buffer but is blocked until the buffer is updated
[ ] Create a dummy 64 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Create a dummy 128 app that updates the buffer with alternating frames
[ ] Allow the dummy 128 app to be rotated if the device contains a sufficient number of frames
[ ] Allow the monome to have two surfaces each containing a different app
[ ] Allow switching between surfaces
