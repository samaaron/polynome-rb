* build test framework

The importance here is ease of testing: both for polynome itself and for apps that use polynome (if they wish to test their interaction with polynome).

Given an OSC message as input, there are two aspects that I can see that need testing:
  1) The output of polynome (this is initially going to be OSC, but I may add serial communications too for direct connection to the monome)
  2) The internal messages for the associated Virtual Monome

Both of these message types could be received by the testing application via OSC.

So, to test application A:

  [*]  - A registers that it wants Polynome to enter test mode
  [*]  - A tells Polynome where it wants the test OSC messages to be sent to
          i.e. /polynome/internal/test/on "localhost", 1234  ; for internal test mode
  [*]  - Polynome reads from a config file where it should send regular OSC output
  [*]  - A VM for app A is created with the correct model and cable orientation
  [ ]  - A is informed (also on initialisation) of the port to listen on
  [ ]  - A's VM is placed in the Rack
  [ ]  - A's VM listens for messages
  [ ]  - A sends OSC messages to A's VM
  [ ]  - Polynome filters out Monome messages and sends them to the Monome
  [ ]  - Polynome sends all (including filtered) OSC messages back to A on the appropriate ports
  [ ]  - Polynome sends all filtered messages onto the monome
  [ ]  - Try Polymer with MLR

It would be useful to build a test harness:

  describe "simple led lighting" do
    it "should be possible to light an led" do
      @app.send("/polynome/led", 0, 5, 1)
      @message = app.receive(:num_messages => 1)
      @message.should == ["/polynome/led", 0, 5, 1]
    end
  end        




* echo messages to monome
* create a thread and listening port for virtual monomes
* echo messages from currently active application to monome
* create switcher to switch between virtual monome screens (slide in / out) 
* receive more advanced messages - boxes, shapes, patterns etc.
* split a monome into separate monomes (e.g. the 256 can become two 128s)
